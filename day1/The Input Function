Input Task Exercise

Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name. Your code should only output the number, no other text is needed.



# assign name to input
name = input()

# use len to calculate the length and print the output
print(len(name))
